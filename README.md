# Practice-Personal-Site-HTML-CSS-V2

In contrast to the 'Practice-Personal-Site-HTML-CSS-V1', this iteration underwent a markedly different development process. Here, I undertook the task of building the site from scratch, concurrently weaving together HTML and CSS with a unified vision. This synchronized approach yielded a more cohesive and polished aesthetic, allowing me to expand upon the foundational concepts established in previous versions. Notably, I leveraged CSS and HTML in tandem to craft a functional slideshow, showcasing a collection of images. Though not flawless, the slideshow demonstrated considerable progress and allowed me to demostrate the skills of CSS Animation that adds more intrest. The only thing I would have prefered with the slide show was to be able to have buttons for movement between slides compare to requiring mouse-hover interaction to halt movement. Moreover with the more complexity and larger scope of the site, I began was using IDs and classes, facilitating the reusability of CSS styles and the organization of elements into logical groupings through <divs>. Overall, this version represents a significant improvement over its predecessors, reflecting both enhanced proficiency and a refined understanding of web development principles.
